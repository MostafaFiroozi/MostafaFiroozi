- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MostafaFiroozi, Computer Vision Engineer at Alascom company in Milan. 
 The main focus of my work is developement of artificial intelligence based image processing algorithms to solve industrial problems in different domains. I usually use python, MATLAB and c++ to do my projects. Here you can see someof my projects in different fields.

Deeplearning: 
[HAND_GESTURE_CLASSIFICATION_BASED_ON_SURFACE_EMG_SIGNALS_FOR_ONLINE_HAND_PROSTHETICS_CONTROL]
Description: [We implemented 5 classical classifiers and a CNN to classify 8 different hand gestures which can be used for control system of Hand Prosthetics.]
Technologies: [Keras, MatplotLib, Pandas, Numpy, MATLAB]
GitHub Repository: [ https://github.com/MostafaFiroozi/HAND_GESTURE_CLASSIFICATION_BASED_ON_SURFACE_EMG_SIGNALS_FOR_ONLINE_HAND_PROSTHETICS_CONTROL ]
